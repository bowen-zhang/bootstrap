# How To Do X in Quickest Way

Very often we have an idea and want to create prototype to demonstrate /
validate / iterate quickly. Best engineering design / decision is not necessary
and will slow down the iteration. Lightning prototyping is key to success.

Thus, this repo is created to demonstrate the quickest way to do X with example
code and instructions. Covered topics includes web app, database, IoT, sensors,
home automation, etc., and will continue to expand.

# How To Use

```

## Understand an Example

See README.md in each example for explanations / instructions.
